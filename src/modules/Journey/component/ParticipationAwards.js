        Something About: I am currently working here as a full stack web
        developer. I work here with a talented team, from where I am learning a
        lot of things about team collaboration. The task is assigned by Jira
        Tickets, where all the description is mentioned. I work in both side
        front-end and back-end when the ticket assign. Also I had to finish
        assigned task in a proper time there I have learned about estimation of
        time. I am still learning about Scalability, Feasibility, and Efficient
        code writing for the feature or project I work with.
